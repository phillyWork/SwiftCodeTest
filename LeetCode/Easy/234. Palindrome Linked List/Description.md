A palindrome is a sequence that reads the same forward and backward.

Given the head of a singly linked list, return true if it is a palindrome or false otherwise.

`Constraints`
- The number of nodes in the list is in the range [1, 105].
- 0 <= Node.val <= 9

`Example`
|Input|Output|
|:-:|:-:|
|head = [1,2,2,1]|true|
|head = [1,2]|false|
