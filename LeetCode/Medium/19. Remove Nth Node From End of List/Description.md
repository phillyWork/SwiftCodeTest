Given the head of a linked list, remove the nth node from the end of the list and return its head.

`Constraints`
- The number of nodes in the list is sz.
- 1 <= sz <= 30
- 0 <= Node.val <= 100
- 1 <= n <= sz

`Example`
|Input|Output|
|:-:|:-:|
|head = [1,2,3,4,5], n = 2|[1,2,3,5]|
|head = [1], n = 1|[]|
|head = [1,2], n = 1|[1]|
